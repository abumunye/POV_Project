The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_Clk_reg__0/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_MOSI_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/o_TX_Ready_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[3]_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[3]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_Clk__0_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_Clk_reg__0/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_MOSI_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LED_Strip/spi/o_SPI_MOSI_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LED_Strip/spi/o_TX_Ready_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LED_Strip/spi/o_TX_Ready_reg/CLR, LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[3]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[0]/CLR, LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[1]/CLR, LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_Rst_H relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[3]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_Strip/spi/r_SPI_Bits_reg[3]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
